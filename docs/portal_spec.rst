Schema
======

**spot_instance**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Name of `AWS EC2 Key Pair <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html>`_ to be used to connect to the instance. The Key Pair should match the identity file.

spot_instance . **identity_file**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Location of identity file (private key) to be used for authentication when connecting to the instance. This file is generated by AWS upon creation of a new Key Pair. The identity file should match the Key Pair.

spot_instance . **security_group_id**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Id of `AWS EC2 Security Group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html>`_ to be associated with the instance. Security Group controls which inbound and outbound traffic is allowed for the instance. Make sure to at least allow inbound ssh traffic (port 22).

spot_instance . **availability_zone**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Name of `AWS Availability Zone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html>`_ in which to launch the instance. Availability Zone has to be within the Region, specified in the :ref:`application config <config>`.

	Note that Spot Instance prices might differ between Availability Zones.

spot_instance . **subnet_id**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	**TODO: can we request it given the AZ?**

spot_instance . **ebs_optimized**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: boolean. Optional.*

	Enable/disable `EBS Optimization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSOptimized.html>`_. An EBS–optimized instance uses an optimized configuration stack and provides additional, dedicated capacity for EBS I/O.

spot_instance . **remote_user**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Default AMI username. For images based on Ubuntu in most cases the username will be *ubuntu*. If in doubt, check AMI usage instructions.

spot_instance . **python_virtual_env**
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Optional.*

	Default Python virtual environment to be used to install extra Python packages. Should be specified when *spot_instance.extra_python_packages* is specified.

spot_instance . **extra_python_packages**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: array of strings. Optional.*

	Extra Python packages to be installed in the default Python virtual environment.

**spot_fleet**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	*Type: object. Required.*

	Specification of a Spot Instance Fleet.

spot_fleet . **iam_fleet_role**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

.. _portal_spec_volumes:

**persistent_volumes**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	*Type: array of objects. Required.*

	Specifications of EBS volumes to be attached. Use :ref:`volume <volume_cmd>` group of commands to manage and list volumes.

persistent_volumes[] . **volume_id**
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Id of EBS volume to be attached to the instance.

persistent_volumes[] . **device**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Name of device to represent the attached volume. For example, ``/dev/xvdf``. See `documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console>`_ for details.

persistent_volumes[] . **mount_point**
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Mounting point within the instance file system, where device representing the volume should be mounted. For example, ``/home/ubuntu/workspace`` (assuming that AMI username is *ubuntu*).

.. _portal_spec_channels:

**channels**
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	*Type: array of objects. Required.*

	Specifications of file synchronization channels.


channels[] . **direction**
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Direction of file transfer. Expected values are "*in*" and "*out*". Inbound channel transfers files from the remote instance to the local machine. Outbound channel transfers files from the local machine to the remote instance. 

channels[] . **local_path**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Local path to be used in synchronization. Note that synchronization is done via ``rsync``, therefore, similar rules regarding the trailing slash (/) in the source path are applied (see :ref:`excerpt <rsync_help>` of rsync help for details).

channels[] . **remote_path**
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

	*Type: string. Required.*

	Remote path to be used in synchronization. Note that synchronization is done via ``rsync``, therefore, similar rules regarding the trailing slash (/) in the source path are applied (see :ref:`excerpt <rsync_help>` of rsync help for details).

	*Type: boolean. Optional.*

	Enable/disable recursive synchronization. Disabled by default.

Deep Learning AMIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**TODO: add details on where to find ids**

.. _rsync_help:

Rsync Help on Trailing Slash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*An excerpt of* ``man rsync``:

Recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar on the machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local machine::

	$ rsync foo:src/bar /data/tmp

A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid creating an additional directory level at the destination::

	$ rsync foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp

You can think of a trailing / on a source as meaning "copy the contents of this directory" as opposed to "copy the directory by name", but in both cases the attributes of the containing directory are transferred to the containing directory on the  destination. In other words, each of the following commands copies the files in the same way, including their setting of the attributes of /dest/foo::

	$ rsync /src/foo /dest
	$ rsync /src/foo/ /dest/foo
